4. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

5. Starting app in IOS
   ```bash
    npm run ios
   ```

6. Reset project to clean state
   ```bash
    npm run reset-project
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Authentication
### Using Clerk
https://clerk.com/

Install the following packages
```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
```

```bash
npx expo install expo-secure-store
```

copy over the following key to .env file client side
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

the CLERK_SECRET_KEY is for the server side

# Routes

```
npx expo-router-sitemap
```

list routes in your project

# Auth Flow
The authflow in an expo project, is why user requests a screen, it
1. Attempt to navigate to `/`
2. Check if user is logged in (authenticated)
- - Yes: open `/`
- - No: redirect to `/login` 

eg;
```
app
â”œâ”€â”€ (drawer)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (chat)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ new.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
â””â”€â”€ login.tsx
```

The logic for auth flow is in `/app/_layout.tsx`, because this file gets executed before any of the screens gets served.

An issue arises with the root layout files is that we can't currently use redirect in the layout file (will be supported in the future). Grouping folder is supported. 

Grouping folder is denoted by round bracket eg. `/(protected)`

Lets create a grouping folder for our protected routes
```
app
â”œâ”€â”€ (protected)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (drawer)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (chat)
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ new.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
â””â”€â”€ login.tsx
```
The layout file in our protected group folder `/(protected)` is free to use redirects.

The content in the `/app` folder that is not in `/(protected)` can be accessed without being authenticated.

`/reactnativegpt/app/(protected)/(drawer)/(chat)/new.tsx` is the path of the new.tsx file. The route starts with the app folder, so the path before and including the app folder is not included in the route. 

Since Expo Router is a file-based routing system, every endpoint corresponds to a file.

The rules for URL base routing in Expo.
1. `index.tsx` is ignored so `app/index.tsx` -> `/`
2. The extensions are ignored eg.
`app/(api)/users.tsx` -> `/api/users`
3. Square brackets denotes dynamic routes eg.
`app/(api)/(users/[id].tsx)` -> `/api/users/123`
- - The parameter values replaces the bracket portion at runtime by redirection. eg. `router.push('/users/123')` 
- - The value can be accessed with `useLocalSearchParams()`
4. Round brackets denotes grouping folders and is between the app folder and the destination file, we can remove the bracket around them.
5. `_layout.tsx` does not define any routes. It defines navigation containers and screen presentation, not routes themselves. They control how screens are displayed and organize the navigation hierarchy for their directory.

`/(protected)/(drawer)/(chat)/new.tsx` -> `/protected/drawer/chat/new`


All the layout files starting with the root layout file in the app folder are loaded, and finally the screen is rendered. The root layout will always get rendered first, and it will return the first navigator, this will start off the navigation tree for your app. This is why you can't use redirects in your root layout, because if we return a redirect in your root layout instead of a navigator, the navigation tree won't exist because the other layout files in the subtree are not loaded yet.

In the Expo Router:
1. The root `_layout.tsx` is the entry point for your app's navigation tree.
2. It must return a navigator component (like `<Stack>`, `<Tabs>`, or `<Drawer>`) to establish the navigation infrastructure.
3. If you try to use redirects in the root layout (like `router.replace('/login')`), it breaks the navigation tree initialization because:
- - The redirect attempts to the navigate before the navigation tree exists
- - The navigator that would handle the redirect hasn't been created yet
- - The subtree layouts aren't loaded, so there's nowhere to redirect to

This is why:
- Put auth checking logic in the root layout.
- Use conditional state variables and `useEffect for redirection
- Place redirects in nested layout files (like inside `/(protected)/_layout.tsx`)
- Use the `segments` and auth state to conditionally render content

The root layout needs to establish the navigation foundation before redirects can work properly. This is a fundamental limitation of how navigation trees are constructed in React Navigation/Expo Router.
